# MyDigitalMe
MyDigitalMe is the technological platform that wants to change the Internet and the way we interact with other persons, organizations and things.

## The way things work today
* There isn't a clear and uniformed representation of us in the Internet
* We don't have any ownership over the data we are producing constantly in our every day life
* Our digital assets are exposed to other people and third parties without our acknowledgement
* There is a market that monetize our data and we are not even informed

## The way things will work tomorrow
* There will be a single representation of us across the Internet
* It will be possible protecting and masking us when there is no need to expose our self
* We will collect all the data generated by others for us to explode
* We will decide wwhat data want to share or expose to the public in general or to certain parties, for how long and for which purpose
* We will obtain revenew by exposing our data in such a way
