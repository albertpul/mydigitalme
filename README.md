# MyDigitalMe

MyDigitalMe is the technological platform that wants to change the way we interact with other persons, organizations and things. These are the key features:

* Personal BigData 

An aggregator for your all digital data spread across the Internet and companies and governs backend, including the inmmense ammount of data gathered by your things

* Digital Identity

A private unique identifier for your self into the digital world, and many other temporal public masked identifiers for other to access your data in a controlled and protected way

* Data Marketplace

A way to obtain revenue when sharing your data with others

# The way things work today
* There isn't a clear and uniformed representation of us in the Internet
* We don't have any ownership over the data we are producing constantly in our every day life
* Our digital assets are exposed to other people and third parties without our acknowledgement
* There is a market that monetize our data and we are not even informed

# The way things will work tomorrow
* There will be a single representation of us across the Internet
* It will be possible protecting and masking us when there is no need to expose our self
* We will collect all the data generated by others for us to explode
* We will decide wwhat data want to share or expose to the public in general or to certain parties, for how long and for which purpose
* We will obtain revenue by exposing our data in such a way

# Is that possible?
It sounds very ambitious but the truth is that this could be tottaly possible.

- Technology provides all the tools to make this happen, in esence is all about changing the current flow direction of data, not from us to Internet and companies but the other way around
- We will define an interface so others will be able to interact with the platform very easily
- Services will be built on top of the platform and will provide added value to everybody

# How are we going to do this
This idea has been around for a long time ago, now it is time to make it happen. These are the steps we will follow:

 1. Define an API for MyDigitalMe
 2. Define the architecture and implement the services
 3. Cover the services with security
 4. Deploy the platform
 5. Let the developer's community to build applications
 
## API
 While MyDigitalMe API could be very extensive to cover all different digital assets, we will focus first on the common functionallities that all them might have. To help identifying such, let's begin with the most simple an basic one: Me API.
 
 Me is the root for all your data, here is a list of different main assets under this path
